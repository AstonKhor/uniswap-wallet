- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading for token logos and charts
- **Network Efficiency**: Batch API calls where possible
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of subscriptions and timers
- **Offline Support**: Cache critical data for offline viewing

### User Experience Priorities
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading and skeleton screens
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with recovery actions
- **Accessibility**: Full accessibility support with proper semantics
- **Responsive Design**: Consistent experience across device sizes
- **Onboarding**: Intuitive first-time user experience
